 To run the demo execute to 'script.sh' at a bash terminal

 This will run the necessary docker commands to build the
 images for the catclient and catserver, as well as the
 shared data volume.

 The client will echo the response received from the server
 as well as 'OK' if the response corresponds to a line
 in the file, or 'MISSING' if it is not.

 The client will send the word 'END' with new line as the last
 request to the server signalling to close the socket when
 it is acknowleged.
